Shit ass AHK script to open the Nth account in your jagex list, works reliably on my computer, but results may vary depending on your computer resolution. place in your BWU directory with loader.exe in it, run by doing 

`./start_account.ahk #`

where # is the index of the account you want to run (it's 1 indexed, so put 1 if you want to run the first account)

mind you there's duplicate code everywhere since i couldn't be arsed to make it good, obviously this requires AHK 2.0 installed
